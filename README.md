# Hi, I'm KHLEE8688 👋

I'm passionate about game development and exploring the intersection of technology and human experience. My journey has led me from competitive programming to pioneering projects involving brain-computer interfaces in game design. Here’s a glimpse into my work:

## 🎮 Projects

- **BCI-Integrated Horror Game**
    
    An immersive horror game integrating **Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)** for real-time interaction with the player's mental state.
    
    - **Role**: Lead developer for all aspects of design, coding, and implementation.
- **2D/3D Hybrid Puzzle Adventure Game**
    
    A creative puzzle adventure blending 2D and 3D gameplay, designed for maximum engagement and innovative storytelling.
    
    - **Role**: Lead Programmer and Director, overseeing core mechanics and game design direction.
- **VR + BCI-Controlled Telepresence Robot** (WIP)
  
    A telepresence system enabling users—especially those with physical limitations—to control a mobile robot via BCI (P300) in a VR environment.
    Combines ROS, YOLO object detection, 360° live streaming, and Unity for immersive interaction.

    - **Role**: System architect and full-stack developer, leading BCI integration, ROS environment setup, and Unity-based VR interface
